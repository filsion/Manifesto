# Fusion Manifesto: The Permanent Storage of Human Civilization

We hereby declare our dedication to establishing a perpetual storage organization that will ensure the enduring existence of all aspects of human civilization.

Our mission is clear: to create a lasting repository of human achievements, struggles, discoveries and failures, and to make them accessible for all. We believe that this is vital not only for the sake of future generations but also for our own understanding of who we are as a species, where we came from and where we hope to go.

To achieve this goal, we must first acknowledge the challenges we face. Rapid technological advancements have made it difficult to keep up with changes in digital storage formats and mediums, and existing archives face constant threats from environmental disasters, wars, and political regimes.

Therefore, we propose an innovative solution. Based on decentralized systems, we believe it is imperative to distribute this archive across multiple remote locations, equally accessible to all humans worldwide. This way, we will be able to bypass the limitations of any one physical location or technical infrastructure and ensure its ongoing survival.

To achieve these aims, we will launch Protostar Project to leverage modern cryptographic techniques, distributed ledger systems, and data redundancy methods to safeguard against loss, corruption, or manipulation of the archival data. The content we preserve will not just consist of plain text and images but also encompass audio recordings, videos, 3D renderings, simulations, and other multimedia. We envision a dynamic archive, capable of adapting to new technological advances and societal changes, where people from all walks of life can contribute their stories, perspectives, and expertise. Through this, we hope to foster an environment that celebrates the diversity of human experience and the shared desire to understand our place in the universe.

In conclusion, we affirm our belief that the preservation of our collective cultural heritage and the enduring existence of human civilization are essential. We must act now and seize this opportunity to create a perpetual storage organization for the future's benefit. Let us embark on this ambitious but necessary endeavor together, knowing that by doing so, we will leave the world better than we found it.
